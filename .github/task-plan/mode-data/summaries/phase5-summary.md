## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Extraction**: Pulled unique airport records from both origin and destination fields
2. **Standardization**: Unified column names and data formats
3. **Deduplication**: Removed duplicates based on Airport ID and Name
4. **Enrichment**: Added airport codes and formatted identifiers
5. **Mapping**: Connected actual airport IDs to model-encoded IDs
6. **Validation**: Comprehensive quality checks and consistency verification
7. **Export**: Clean CSV export with proper formatting

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ **Data Completeness**: No missing values in critical fields
- ✅ **Consistency**: All airport IDs unique and properly formatted
- ✅ **Integrity**: Model mapping verified for all 70 origin airports
- ✅ **Usability**: Clear, descriptive identifiers for easy lookup
- ✅ **Format**: Standard CSV with proper escaping and encoding

## Usage Guidelines

### For External Applications
1. **Airport Lookup**: Use AirportID or AirportCode for airport identification
2. **Model Integration**: Use ModelAirportID for ML model predictions (1-70 range)
3. **Display**: Use AirportIdentifier for user-friendly airport display
4. **Geographic Filtering**: Filter by State for regional analysis

### Integration with ML Model
```python
# Load airport reference
airports = pd.read_csv('airports.csv')

# Find airport by code
airport_info = airports[airports['AirportCode'] == 'LAX']

# Get model ID for prediction
model_id = airport_info['ModelAirportID'].iloc[0]

# Use with flight delay model
prediction = predict_flight_delay(day_of_week=1, origin_airport_id=model_id)
```

## Business Value
