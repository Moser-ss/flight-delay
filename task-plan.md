## 📝 Notes and Considerations

- The dataset is from 2013, so model may need updating for current use
- Consider seasonal variations in flight delays
- Airport codes should be standardized (IATA/ICAO)
- Model interpretability may be important for business use
- Consider computational efficiency for real-time predictions
- **Current Model Limitation**: High accuracy but low recall for delayed flights (class imbalance issue)
- **Production Ready**: Model is fully exported and documented for external use
