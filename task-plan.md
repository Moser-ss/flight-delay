# Flight Delay Prediction Model - Task Plan

## 📋 Project Overview

This task plan outlines the implementation strategy for creating a machine learning model that predicts flight delays based on the FAA dataset from 2013. The model will predict the probability of a flight being delayed by more than 15 minutes given a day of the week and an airport.

## 📝 Notes and Considerations

- The dataset is from 2013, so model may need updating for current use
- Consider seasonal variations in flight delays
- Airport codes should be standardized (IATA/ICAO)
- Model interpretability may be important for business use
- Consider computational efficiency for real-time predictions
- **Current Model Limitation**: High accuracy but low recall for delayed flights (class imbalance issue)
