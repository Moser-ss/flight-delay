# Phase 2 - Task 2 Summary: Data Cleaning

**Date**: August 28, 2025  
**Task**: Phase 2, Task 2 - Data Cleaning  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## 📋 Task Overview

**Objective**: Replace all null values with zero as specified in requirements, handle data type inconsistencies, and remove or handle any obviously erroneous records.

**Implementation**: Added comprehensive data cleaning workflow to `explore-flight-data.ipynb` notebook with four dedicated cells covering pre-cleaning analysis, implementation, validation, and final conclusions.

## 🎯 Task Execution Summary

### Pre-Cleaning State
- **Dataset Size**: 271,940 rows × 20 columns (5,438,800 total cells)
- **Missing Values**: 2,761 missing values (0.05% of dataset)
- **Affected Column**: Only `DepDel15` had missing values (1.02% of column)
- **Missing Pattern**: All missing values corresponded to cancelled flights

### Cleaning Implementation
- **Method**: Used pandas `fillna(0)` to replace all missing values with zero
- **Scope**: Applied to entire dataset to ensure comprehensive cleaning
- **Preservation**: Created copy of original data before cleaning to prevent data loss
- **Validation**: Multi-step verification process to ensure data integrity

### Post-Cleaning Results
- **Missing Values**: **0** (reduced from 2,761)
- **Dataset Completeness**: **100%** (perfect completeness achieved)
- **Data Integrity**: All original rows and columns preserved
- **Shape Consistency**: 271,940 rows × 20 columns maintained

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis Results

### Missing Value Resolution
| Metric | Before Cleaning | After Cleaning | Change |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Total missing values** | 2,761 | 0 | -2,761 ✅ |
| **Dataset completeness** | 99.95% | 100.0% | +0.05% |
| **DepDel15 missing** | 2,761 (1.02%) | 0 (0%) | -100% |

### DepDel15 Column Transformation
**Before Cleaning**:
- Value 0: 215,038 flights
- Value 1: 54,141 flights  
- Missing (NaN): 2,761 flights

**After Cleaning**:
- Value 0: 217,799 flights (+2,761)
- Value 1: 54,141 flights (unchanged)
- Missing: 0 flights

### Business Logic Validation

#### Cancelled Flights Analysis
- **Total cancelled flights**: 2,916
- **Cancelled with DepDel15 = 0**: 2,834 flights (97.2%)
  - These were cancelled before departure (no delay measured)
- **Cancelled with DepDel15 = 1**: 82 flights (2.8%)
  - These were delayed >15 minutes then cancelled (legitimate delays)

#### Key Insights
1. **Correct Business Logic**: The 82 cancelled flights with DepDel15 = 1 represent flights that were delayed first, then cancelled - this is valid business logic
2. **Proper Cleaning**: The 2,761 missing values correctly converted to 0, representing flights cancelled before departure
3. **Data Integrity**: No legitimate delay data was lost or incorrectly modified

## 📊 Final Dataset Statistics

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: 100% (5,438,800/5,438,800 cells)
- **Consistency**: All data types validated and appropriate
- **Integrity**: No data loss, all business rules preserved

### Flight Delay Distribution
- **Not Delayed (DepDel15 = 0)**: 217,799 flights (80.1%)
- **Delayed >15min (DepDel15 = 1)**: 54,141 flights (19.9%)

### Data Types Confirmed
- **Numeric columns**: Properly typed as int64/float64
- **Categorical columns**: Maintained as object type
- **DepDel15**: Remains float64 (appropriate for binary indicator)

## ✅ Task Objectives Achievement

### Requirements Compliance
- [x] **Replace null values with zero**: ✅ All 2,761 missing values replaced with 0
- [x] **Handle data type inconsistencies**: ✅ All data types validated and consistent
- [x] **Handle erroneous records**: ✅ No erroneous records found; all data validated

### Quality Assurance
- [x] **Data integrity preserved**: ✅ Shape and content maintained except intended changes
- [x] **Business logic maintained**: ✅ Delay patterns and cancelled flight logic preserved
- [x] **Validation performed**: ✅ Multi-step verification completed
- [x] **Documentation created**: ✅ Comprehensive analysis and conclusions documented

## 💡 Technical Implementation Details

### Cleaning Strategy
```python
# Create backup copy
df_cleaned = df.copy()

# Replace all missing values with 0
df_cleaned = df_cleaned.fillna(0)

# Update main dataframe
df = df_cleaned
```

### Validation Checks
1. **Missing Value Count**: Verified reduction to 0
2. **Shape Preservation**: Confirmed same dimensions
3. **Column Integrity**: Ensured no unintended changes
4. **Business Logic**: Validated cancelled flight patterns
5. **Data Type Consistency**: Confirmed appropriate types

## 🚀 Impact on Project Success

### Model Development Readiness
- **100% Complete Data**: No missing values to handle during modeling
- **Clean Target Variable**: DepDel15 ready for binary classification
- **Preserved Business Logic**: Model will train on correct delay patterns
- **No Data Loss**: Full dataset available for training

### Next Phase Preparation
- **Feature Engineering Ready**: Clean data ready for day-of-week extraction
- **Model Training Ready**: Binary target variable properly coded
- **Airport Analysis Ready**: Complete airport data for reference file creation

## 🔄 Next Steps (Task 3: Feature Engineering)

### Immediate Actions
1. **Extract day of week** from date columns
2. **Create binary delay indicator** (already completed via DepDel15)
3. **Standardize airport codes** and names
4. **Encode categorical variables** as needed for modeling

### Expected Outcomes
